      1) Three main android app pages: 
            Annoucements - Will have updates and reminders on events
            Contact Page - Static information about the company
            Success Stories - Will have updates on students who successfully completed the college IDA program
      2) Ease of administrative access
            This has been achieved by creating a Weebly.com website for the administrator to access.
            Client will be able to easily update stories, announcements, and events.  
            *There will also be a help page to guide administrators

          A PACE-LA android icon

D. Suggestions for starting similar projects
  - Communicate and understand what your client wants/ does not want.
  - Listen to Prof. Ashraf, create a good plan.
  - Have a sketch on what the final android app will look like, because it helps the design process and everyone on the team     will be on the same page. 
  - Use GitHub, because it is an extremely useful tool.
